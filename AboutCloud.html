          <strong>Platform as a Service</strong> or <strong>PaaS</strong> is a category of cloud computing services that provides a platform allowing customers to develop, run, and manage applications without the complexity of building and maintaining the infrastructure typically associated with developing and launching an app. <strong>Infrastructure as a service</strong> or <strong>IaaS</strong> is an instant computing infrastructure, provisioned and managed over the Internet. Quickly scale up and down with demand, and pay only for what you use.

          IaaS helps you avoid the expense and complexity of buying and managing your own physical servers and other datacenter infrastructure. Each resource is offered as a separate service component, and you only need to rent a particular one for as long as you need it. The core concept of <strong>Communication as a Service</strong> is that accessing services over the internet is extremely convenient. The client businesses do not have to worry about maintaining servers and connections, uploading different kinds of content or doing all of the administrative work involved in keeping a communications platform functional. Business users just sign in and use the services. Types of <strong>CaaS</strong> include internet telephone solutions, and video conferencing services.

            <h3>The Different Cloud Services</h3>
            <p><strong>Software as a Service</strong> or <strong>SaaS</strong> is a way of delivering applications over the Internet â€“ as a service. Also known as cloud software, ASP, on-demand software or hosted software. The first applications for consumers were things like webmail, bookmarking and photo sharing. In business, things like recruitment, expenses and customer relationship management were among the early innovations. SaaS has since become a widely-used business model with more and more different kinds of applications available via the cloud.</p>
